                    Since the theme is about environmental protection, this gave me the first idea of the fireflies that were everywhere in the woods in the countryside when I was a kid, but now they have disappeared because of environmental problems. So I would like to make the background of the website have an effect of fireflies in the sky. Once to remember the scenes of the past and promote environmental protection.
                </br></br>
                    To echo the background and the text, I chose two more vibrant fonts and two main colors of fireflies as the main color scheme for the text.
