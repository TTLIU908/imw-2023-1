                <p>
                    I set the theme of my project to be about two memorable events from my winter break traveling to and from Toronto and my hometown. Also, sending New Year's wishes to everyone who visits my website.

                    This is a paragraph section where you can place your writing such as how you framed the project, what inspired you, what kind of research did you do, how did your idea evolve, what were key points of your refinement process, etc. Each paragraph will need to go into a separate paragraph tag.
